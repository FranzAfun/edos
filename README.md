## Overview

EDOS is the centralized internal operating system for ERA AXIS.

It integrates:

- Performance Management (KPI System)
- Financial Governance
- Treasury & Budget Control
- Revenue Tracking
- Asset Management
- Attendance Monitoring
- Communication Logging
- Executive Intelligence Dashboard

This platform is not an accounting tool.

It is a behavior-control and decision-support system that enforces:

Work → Proof → Score → Trust → Approval → Spending → Verification → Insight

## Tech Stack

Frontend:
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS (planned)

Backend:
- Node.js

Version Control:
- Git (main + dev branching model)

## Branch Strategy

## System Philosophy

- Budget is spending permission, not money transfer.
- Treasury balance is separate from department budgets.
- Spending is controlled before it happens.
- Authority is earned through measurable performance.
- All actions must be logged and auditable.
